# Task 8: Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark

## Objective
To capture and analyze HTTP network traffic using Wireshark.

## What I Did
- Opened Wireshark and selected the Wi-Fi interface.
- Started packet capturing.
- Visited `http://neverssl.com` in my browser to generate HTTP traffic.
- Applied the filter `http` in the top display bar.
- Observed HTTP `GET` and `200 OK` packets.
- Stopped the capture and saved it as `wireshark_capture.pcap`.

## Files Included
- `wireshark_capture.pcap` â€“ the saved capture file
- Screenshot showing HTTP filter and captured packets
- This `README.md` file

##  What I Learned
- How to use Wireshark to monitor real-time traffic
- The difference between HTTP and HTTPS
- How to use filters in Wireshark to view specific types of traffic

## Tool Used
- Wireshark 4.4.7 on Windows
